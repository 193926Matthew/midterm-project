            There was only one scene in the project, unless the motion of the bucket and fire are counted separately, so that means I helped with all of it. To be specific, I worked on the props of the box, the background and foreground of the box, and the position of the motors in the box. I had originally made the fire prop, but since it was too big to use our team had decided to use a different fire prop to fit easier.

            The project used motors provided to use to rotate props around, in our project that would be the fire and bucket of water. The coding I had done for the box was all on the 13th after this class to finish up the code since it hadnâ€™t been working for a previously unknown reason (The reason was because the code being written was on a mac which caused it not to work for some reason). This finishing up the code was to adjust angles, timing, and for it to reset after being activated.

            It will show that even when everything is going wrong, that is still a way to a solution. The hope is that the animation exhibits that feeling of hope of a solution in the worse circumstances.

            This Loopy model shows how connected the issue of forest fires, excessive carbon emmisions, and climate change are connected. No matter how it starts, all of these elements lead and cause more of another. This is clearly a negative, so this project shows how that there needs to be something done about at least one of these, our group chose to focus on forest fires.

            This code is used to both move the bucket of water to spill its water on the fire and move the fire downwards when it is extingusihed. This code works by utilizing a touch sensor to activate cricket motors when a person touches it. The cricket motors, once activated, will change their rotation and since the motors are connected to both the ffire and bucket they'll rotate the props accordingly.

            This was the original design of the storyboard; however, it got changed heavily throughout the creation process. The main focus of a forest fire being extinguished was still maintained through the entire project. The original vision was to have an antagonist who started the fire and a group of protagonists that helped extinguish the fire. This was later scrapped since there really isn't just a singular person who starts these fires, the same thing for people who extinguishes them. A small bucket was used in the final project to still represent that no matter how small the force may seem, it can still make a big difference.
