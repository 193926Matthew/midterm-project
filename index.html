            This Loopy model shows how connected the issue of forest fires, excessive carbon emmisions, and climate change are connected. No matter how it starts, all of these elements lead and cause more of another. This is clearly a negative, so this project shows how that there needs to be something done about at least one of these, our group chose to focus on forest fires.

            This code is used to both move the bucket of water to spill its water on the fire and move the fire downwards when it is extingusihed. This code works by utilizing a touch sensor to activate cricket motors when a person touches it. The cricket motors, once activated, will change their rotation and since the motors are connected to both the ffire and bucket they'll rotate the props accordingly.

        <h3> Storyboard </h3>
        <p>
            This was the original design of the storyboard; however, it got changed heavily throughout the creation process. The main focus of a forest fire being extinguished was still maintained through the entire project. The original vision was to have an antagonist who started the fire and a group of protagonists that helped extinguish the fire. This was later scrapped since there really isn't just a singular person who starts these fires, the same thing for people who extinguishes them. A small bucket was used in the final project to still represent that no matter how small the force may seem, it can still make a big difference.
